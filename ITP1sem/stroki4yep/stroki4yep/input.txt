John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (03.01.1892 – 02.09.1973) was an English writer and philologist. He was the author of the high fantasy works The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.
The request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what became his most famous work: the epic novel The Lord of the Rings (originally published in three volumes in 1954–1955).
